# Hotel Booking Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Hotel Booking Analysis & Prediction** repository!
This project explores hotel booking data to analyze customer behavior, booking trends, and cancellations. It provides a comprehensive view of the factors affecting booking cancellations and identifies the best periods for hotel visits.

This project was built as part of my portfolio to demonstrate data analysis, machine learning, and visualization skills using real-world hotel data.

#### Objective
- Understand booking patterns and seasonal trends.
- Analyze hotel cancellation behavior.
- Predict booking cancellations using machine learning.
- Provide actionable insights for hotel management.

### Features & KPIs
- **Booking Trends:** Number of bookings by month and by hotel type.
- **Cancellation Analysis:** Insights into cancellations and confirmed bookings.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Top countries visiting and guest demographics.
- **Seasonal Insights:** Best months and seasons to visit hotels.
- **Machine Learning Prediction:** Random Forest model to predict booking cancellations.
- **Feature Importance:** Key factors influencing cancellations.

#### Tools & Technologies
- **Data Analysis & ML:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Storage:** CSV

### Insights & Findings

- Booking cancellations are more frequent in certain months (between April & October).
- City hotels tend to have higher ADR (Average Daily Rate) than city hotels.
- Key factors affecting cancellations include lead_time, adr, and deposit type.
- Most bookings come from countries like [Portugal, GBR, Spain, France, Italy].

**Recommendations:** Hotels can utilize these insights to manage overbooking, refine pricing strategies, and enhance guest retention during high-risk cancellation periods.
